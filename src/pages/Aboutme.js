                Hello, and welcome to my personal website, which I coded in
                React. This website first started out as a project for learning
                the React library but sooner than later I realized that rather
                than leaving it in some repository and never touching it again,
                I can use this to be an archive of interests and research,
                aswell as a resourse for job recruiters to check out. While many
                people journal about their thoughts and idea's with physical pen
                and paper, I can code my thoughts and ideas into this website
                deciding which information can remain public or private. It is a
                limitless sandbox, which I can look back at one day, see how
                much I have acomplished and hopefully feel satisfied.
              </p>

              <h2>Education</h2>
              <p>
                Starting in high school, I attended a small private classical
                Christian school. This experience profoundly changed my
                perspective on academics, reshaping my outlook on learning and
                challenging my previous understandings. The school offered
                courses in Koine Greek, Latin, Philosophy, History, and many
                other valuable subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                After high school, I enrolled in a classical-taught program in
                Pennsylvania to study Electrical Engineering. However, due to
                COVID-19 moving classes online, I took a gap year, working at a
                small upholstery shop while learning about programming in python
                and the mechanics of options in the stock market. This gap year
                is what sparked my interest in finance, I was constantly
                learning. From using options to hedge to forex, to bonds, even
                to learning about commodity futures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward to the end of my gap year, I applied to James
                Madison University and was accepted. Initially, I pursued
                Computer Science due to my strong interest in programming.
                However, I was denied entry into the major. After retaking a
                class and performing exceptionally well, I reapplied—only to be
                denied again. The JMU CS department cited that they had accepted
                too many applicants that cycle. This was a disappointing
                setback, but I refused to settle for something less challenging.
                I wanted my education to be rigorous and worth the investment.
                Ultimately, I chose to study Mathematics, a field that pushes me
                intellectually. Now, I am on track to graduate on time with a
                Math degree and a Computational Analytics concentration, all
                without extending my studies. I look forward to the future and
                remain committed to pursuing difficult and meaningful
                challenges.
